<p>“It should be general knowledge owned by everyone to understand how a
computer can be programmed. It is critical from a democratic perspective
that everyone has basic knowledge in computer science and programming,
so that every citizen can participate in shaping tomorrow’s society.
Programming is a creative activity that connects mathematics, language,
science, social studies with a culture of of global collaboration.”
