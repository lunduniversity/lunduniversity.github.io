## Learn how to program

Lär dig programmera!

"Det är allmänbildning att förstå hur en dator kan programmeras. Det är också viktigt ur demokratisk synvinkel att alla har grundkunskaper i datalogi och programmering för att alla ska kunna vara med och forma morgondagens samhälle. Att programmera är ett kreativt skapande som kopplar samman matematik, Svenska, NO, SO med kultur och globalt samarbete." *Björn Regnell, professor i datavetenskap, Lunds universitet.*
