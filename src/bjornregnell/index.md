## Learn how to program!

"It should be general knowledge owned by everyone to understand how a computer can be programmed. It is critical from a democratic perspective that everyone has basic knowledge in computer science and programming, so that every citizen can participate in shaping tomorrow’s society. Programming is a creative activity that connects mathematics, language, science, social studies with a culture of of global collaboration." *Björn Regnell, Professor of Computer Science, Lund University.*
